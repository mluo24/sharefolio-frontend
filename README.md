# Frontend for Sharefolio

This project was made to expand on a personal project I did a while ago (sharefolio) and to present as what I've learned by the end of the semester for a DTI newbie dev assignment. 

*Note: if you see another contributor to this repository, that's me. I created this on a loaner laptop where I didn't realize the git username and email was set to someone else's account.*
